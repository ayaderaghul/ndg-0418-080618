27/05/2018: check

- what-next? (inverse matrix)

- output file name w delta and location -> gen-name (main) -> done

- generate deltas list in advance -> cons.rkt done

affect: interact*, match-population, evolve, main..

- continue sim from previous sim: main -> done

- random-decimal: if n = 0 instead of if prob = 0
no bc this one is deterministic?

- pic has title? and export in png: gen-pic-name ->done
affect: plot-mean: add tit

30/05/2018: 

- population comprises of all the same automaton: same payoff -> fitness calculation: division by zero

31/05/2018:

- switch output name: 199pic to 991pic -> same delta pics stay next to each other

- add benchmark: test with L M H A itself



- interact-r: return pay only
- create-matrix, print-matrix with solutions: done


todos:

- draw the machines w dot: done

- invest at cycle x out of y

- plot-interval

- print out report on simulation -> better reports

- plot personality test

9/6/18

- testing the 4 machine representative set

- run the rep
